A tool that is designed to be an updated Sappy.

## To Do (No particular order)

1. Fix cross-thread communications between the UI and the currently-playing instruments
2. Add Noise & Wave instruments
3. Fix frequencies of SquareWave instruments
4. Add forced panpot
5. Fix playing a song while one is already playing stopping at first
6. Config & UI
7. Fix only DirectSound instruments stopping when the song ends
8. Add reverse playback
9. Add pitch & volume modulation
10. Add support for MIDI keyboards

12. Add SquareWave sweeping
13. Add KEYSH
14. Add "note off with noise" for SquareWaves
15. Add base note
