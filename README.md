## Some Advantages Over Sappy
* Pause button
* You can play the in-game instruments with a MIDI-in keyboard
* You can view and edit track events
* You can import MIDI files without having to convert them yourself
* You can save the voice tables to a SF2 soundfont file
* The UI scales to the desired window size
* It is not intimidating to use
* You can see representation of notes being played
* Support for multiple song tables

## To Do (No particular order)

* Add reverb DSP effect
* Add reverse playback
* Add SquareWave sweeping
* Add "note off with noise" for SquareWaves
* Fix ADSR on PSG instruments
* Find out why some instruments sound strange \[Example: Mario Kart Snow Land drum\]
* Make the program run at 60 updates like the GBA, which might decrease CPU usage and will correct ADSR
* Add playing playlist from Games.yaml and fading out after a configurable amount of loops
* Maybe a nice waveform
* Finish integrating SF2 writing
* Songtable finder
* Exception handling for invalid config
* Add keyboard shortcuts to the UI
* Let on-screen piano play notes or interact with MIDI keyboard
* Remove "private set" in config and add saving of config
* Fix UI crashing when some invalid songs are switched to
* Support pret dissassembly projects if they need that
