## To Do (No particular order)

* Fix pausing/stopping not always releasing the instruments
* Fix playing a song while one is already playing stopping at first
* Add Noise & Wave instruments
* Fix frequencies of SquareWave instruments
* Config & UI
* Add reverse playback
* Add pitch & volume modulation
* Add support for MIDI keyboards
* Let KeySplits support non-DirectSound instruments
* Add SquareWave sweeping
* Add KEYSH
* Add "note off with noise" for SquareWaves
* Add base note (especially for drums)
* Fix minor popping (I think it's the notes releasing too early)
* Fix notes deciding not to play at all
* Make MusicPlayer a singleton
