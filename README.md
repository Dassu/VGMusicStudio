## To Do (No particular order)

* Drums are a bit funky sometimes, I have to check how they work again
* Figure out GB instrument frequency scale
* Add reverse playback
* Add pitch & volume modulation
* Add SquareWave sweeping
* Add KEYSH
* Add "note off with noise" for SquareWaves
* Add playing playlist from Games.yaml and fading out after a configurable amount of loops
* Fix songs not releasing before dying
* Maybe a nice waveform
* Fix audible velocity abruption when notes are overridden by others (noticeable when the DirectSound limit is 5)
* Finish integrating SF2 writing
* MIDI saving of songs
* Songtable finder
* Re-enable 256 length voice tables
* Give instruments a defined color and have the bars show those colors, along with the keys on the piano
* Exception handling for config
